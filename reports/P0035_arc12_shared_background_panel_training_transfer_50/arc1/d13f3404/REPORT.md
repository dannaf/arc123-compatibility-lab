# ARC1 `d13f3404` P0035-ARC12-SHARED-BACKGROUND-PANEL-TRAINING-TRANSFER-50 Brain Surgery Report

## Outcome: NO — TEST CELLS DO NOT ALL MATCH

- **Compared positions:** 36
- **Mismatched cells:** 36
- **Training compatibility:** `False`
- **Fallback used:** `True`
- **Selected hypothesis:** `fallback_identity_complete_grid`
- **Source commit:** `085f6dbe39050afac3d1d743f840bac95b1a8d1c`
- **Frozen controller commit:** `e869c4842817624925e6576a1be9bb1f27399977`

## Live-Agent Boundary

The controller receives only visible training input/output examples and test inputs. It receives no task ID, imported cohort metadata, GT feature contract, GT solver, historical decomposition, or held-out output before committing a complete grid. The expected output appears only in post-answer V&V.

## Frozen Measurement

The controller bytes, generic operator vocabulary, source task checksums, and cohort membership were frozen before this task was parsed or scored. This result cannot tune the frozen controller.

## Post-Answer V&V

### Test case 1
- **All cells match:** `False`
- **Mismatched cells:** `36`
- **Prediction:**
```json
[[0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 9]]
```
- **Expected output (post-answer only):**
```json
[[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9]]
```
