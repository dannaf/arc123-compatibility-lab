# ARC2 `cd3c21df` P0031-ARC12-CONTIGUOUS-COMPONENT-DEVELOPMENT-40 Brain Surgery Report

## Outcome: YES — ALL TEST CELLS MATCH

- **Compared positions:** 6
- **Mismatched cells:** 0
- **Training compatibility:** `True`
- **Fallback used:** `False`
- **Selected hypothesis:** `unique_component_crop`
- **Source commit:** `71f86ff4c5304e452e0659131171f0519b50e21c`
- **Frozen controller commit:** `fd3ac79b5415d0f7b42747c5bff19829802ccde3`

## Live-Agent Boundary

The controller receives only visible training input/output examples and test inputs. It receives no task ID, imported cohort metadata, GT feature contract, GT solver, historical decomposition, or held-out output before committing a complete grid. The expected output appears only in post-answer V&V.

## Corpus-Callosum Visualization

- Full explicit event record: [`learning_trace.json`](learning_trace.json)

## Frozen Measurement

The controller bytes, generic operator vocabulary, source task checksums, and cohort membership were frozen before this task was parsed or scored. This result cannot tune the frozen controller.

## Post-Answer V&V

### Test case 1
- **All cells match:** `True`
- **Mismatched cells:** `0`
- **Prediction:**
```json
[[4, 8], [8, 8], [8, 4]]
```
- **Expected output (post-answer only):**
```json
[[4, 8], [8, 8], [8, 4]]
```

## Observable IHL Walkthrough
